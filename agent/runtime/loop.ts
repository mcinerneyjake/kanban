3. If a clear, OPEN duplicate or closely related ticket exists, prefer update_ticket over creating a new one. Each search result includes a "status" — IGNORE archived or done tickets as update targets (they are closed); create a new ticket instead, and you may reference the related closed one.
4. Only call create_ticket when nothing OPEN on the board already covers the issue.
