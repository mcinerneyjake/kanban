// tkt-e18d0c20d6b6. Adapted from ticket-workflow's src/repoHygiene.test.ts, which paid for the
// design. kanban is PUBLIC and now carries a gitignored `repos.local.json` full of absolute paths
// and private project names, one directory away from tracked files — so "no local identifiers here"
// stopped being safe as convention and needed a gate.
//
// The check that motivated this test was itself wrong: a hand-run `git grep -l` for the account name
// in ONE capitalization returned zero over the index and was reported clean, while the lowercase
// spelling sat in server/terminal.test.ts. A negative control that sweeps one spelling of the thing
// you are hunting licenses exactly the wrong conclusion — the shape that hid a real account in
// ticket-workflow too. The regex below never had that flaw; the human grep did.
//
// PLACEHOLDER-AWARE, not shape-blind: fixtures legitimately need home paths to exercise path
// parsing, so banning the shape outright is what forces a stale exclusion list to exist. What is
// banned is a home path naming a REAL account. Prefer rewriting an offending example over adding to
// PLACEHOLDERS — a growing exclusion list is how the predecessor check rotted into always-fires.

// `/Users/<owner>` and `/home/<owner>` need NO trailing slash — `HOME=/Users/user` at end of line is
// exactly the leak a slash-requiring pattern misses.
//
// The PREFIX is matched in both natural cases (`/Users/`, `/users/`, `/home/`, `/Home/`) because
// macOS is case-insensitive, so `/users/<account>/…` is a working path that shells and tools really
// emit — a review staged that spelling and the suite passed green. A blanket `i` flag is still
// wrong: it would also match the all-caps `HOME` that appears in ordinary prose ("mount/HOME/git"),
// which is a false positive this file already tripped over once.
//
// DECLARED LIMITS, so they are not mistaken for coverage: an all-caps `/USERS/` or `/HOME/` prefix
// is not matched (not a real path spelling, and matching it reintroduces the prose collision), and
// the classifier is LINE-scoped, so a path wrapped across two lines in a long markdown doc clears it.
