// Pins the persistent embedding cache to a throwaway dir. tkt-9f09b3a1e95c made that cache
// default-ON (it was opt-in via EMBED_CACHE_PATH), so any suite building an index would
// otherwise resolve defaultCachePath() to the REAL board cache and prune() it down to its own
// stub corpus — silently destroying a developer's warm cache and forcing a full cold re-embed.

// Keyed by pid, NOT mkdtemp: vitest evaluates setupFiles once per TEST FILE, so mkdtemp would
// mint a fresh directory for every one of the ~87 suites and leak them all (nothing here can
// register a cleanup hook that outlives the file). One deterministic dir per worker process is
// reused across that worker's files and stays a single bounded artifact.
