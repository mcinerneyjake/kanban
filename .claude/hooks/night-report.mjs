// SessionStart: tell the morning session what last night's run left outstanding (tkt-4ea4e17f1419).
//
// WHY A HOOK. CLAUDE.md's session startup offers `todo` tickets, so a night-run PR sitting in `qa` is
// invisible at exactly the moment somebody could merge it. Prose in a governing doc would be the
// honour-system version of this; a hook fires whether or not anyone remembers to look.
//
// LOCAL AND CHEAP ONLY — no network, no `gh`. This runs before the session is usable, so a hung call
// stalls every startup. Resolving each ticket's real PR lives in `npm run night:report`, which a
// human runs once this points at it.
//
// NODE BUILTINS ONLY, AND THAT IS WHY THE FOUR HELPERS BELOW ARE NOT IMPORTED (review, MEDIUM).
// `scripts/night-run.mjs` and `guard-unattended-merge.mjs` own the originals, but BOTH resolve
// `ticket-workflow` out of node_modules — night-run.mjs:20 imports the guard, which imports the
// package. A checkout that has not installed, or is mid dependency-bump (CLAUDE.md requires an
// install *inside* a worktree), would then throw ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND at import time: before any
// try/catch, degrading every session start in the repo AND emitting nothing. Sixteen lines of
// duplication is the cheap side of that trade for a startup-critical path. `readsSameRootAs` in the
// test file pins this copy to the original so the two cannot drift silently.
//
// DERIVED, NEVER STORED. The outstanding set is recomputed from each ticket's CURRENT status on every
// start, so a ticket reaching `done` or `archived` drops out on its own — there is no acknowledgement
// file to go stale. A merged PR whose ticket was never set `done` keeps nagging, which is correct:
// the board is lying and the report shows the discrepancy. The one case with no automatic exit is a
// DELETED ticket: `readStatus` then returns null forever, which counts as outstanding by design, so
// clearing it means removing that `.night-run/<stamp>/` directory by hand.
//
// SILENCE IS THE PERMISSIVE ANSWER. Every path that cannot read something emits a line rather than
// returning clean, and an unreadable ticket status counts as outstanding. A hook that prints nothing
// is indistinguishable from a hook that did not run.
