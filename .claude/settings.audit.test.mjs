// The machine-wide runtime at ~/.claude/tools carries its OWN ticket-workflow pin, invisible to every
// repo's audit — so it skews silently. Found 2026-08-18 at v0.16.0 against repos on v0.18.0+: the
// NUL-byte write guard was live only for kanban-rooted sessions, while every other repo drove the
// central board through a server without it (tkt-876ab4261e69).
//
// That install is where the USER-SCOPE guards actually resolve from: ~/.claude/settings.json wires
// each one as `run-hook.mjs <name> <closed|open>`, which imports `ticket-workflow/hooks/<name>.mjs`
// from this prefix. So its version is not a detail of one repo — it is the version of guard-bash on
// the machine.
//
// Like the settings.local.json block above, this can never be a CI gate: ~/.claude/tools is
// legitimately absent there. Every read below therefore happens INSIDE a test, never in this describe
// body — an unguarded JSON.parse out here fails the whole FILE with a SyntaxError naming no path,
// taking every settings.json and guard-bash assertion with it, and .husky/pre-commit runs `npm test`,
// so that would block every local commit while pointing at nothing.
