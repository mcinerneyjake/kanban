# Kanban Project

React + Vite frontend, Express API, markdown files as the database (no SQL). The ticket engine lives
upstream in the pinned **`ticket-workflow`** package.

**This file is the instructions.** The reasoning, incidents and measurements behind each rule are in
`docs/claude-md/` (`tkt-755358e09d94`) — **records, not instructions**: dated, and superseded wherever
this file disagrees. Do not lift prose back out without re-verifying the claim.

**Writing these documents.** Editing *this* file: **for mutable external state — workflow states, rulesets, secrets, versions —
write the probe, not the answer**, and **a claim about code in this repo belongs in a test**
(`.claude/settings.audit.test.mjs` is the home). A governing-doc change is never "trivial": docs-only
changes skip tests, they do **not** skip the review gate.

## Session startup (MANDATORY — always do this before anything else)

**When the opening message is a ticket or implementation request:**

1. `list_tickets` to load the board.
2. Print a one-line summary: counts by status (`3 backlog · 2 todo · 1 in-progress`).
3. **Recommend the skill as the default path** (below) — a line of output, not a checkpoint. Never
   withhold step 4 behind it.
4. If the message names a ticket, match it and `start_ticket` directly; skip the prompt.
5. Otherwise, if any are `todo`, offer them with `AskUserQuestion` (single-select; `label` = title,
   `description` = `[priority] type`, plus a final "Skip").
6. On a pick, `start_ticket` — it marks in-progress and returns the body in one call.

Nothing `todo` → show the summary and wait. **Escape hatch:** a meta, analysis, planning or
configuration request with no ticket implied skips the board load and is answered directly, **step 3
included**.

### Recommending `/kanban-workflow`

Print the invocation on its own line:

```
/kanban-workflow <project> --gates manual
```

- **Substitute `<project>` before printing.** A literal `<project>` resolves against a project not on
  the board instead of falling through to the skill's own menu.
- **`--gates manual` is fixed** — never inferred from phrasing, never reused from the last run.
- **A recommendation, not a redirect** — if the user goes straight at a ticket, continue with 4–6.
- **Suppress it entirely** when the opening message *is* the invocation, when the skill is already
  running, or when it was declined once this session. Ask once.

`skillContract.test.mjs` requires exactly one invocation here, carrying no ticket id, at the `--gates`
level `SKILL.md` §15's handoff uses. That level is **derived** from SKILL.md's gate table, not
merely compared between the two files — pre-filling an auto level reddens the suite *even when both
files agree on it*. The rest of this subsection is honor-system prose.

## MCP server and the board

`.mcp.json` wires the `kanban` server (project scope, auto-starts): `list_tickets`, `get_ticket`,
`start_ticket`, `create_ticket`, `update_ticket`, `delete_ticket`, `record_review` and
`archive_ticket`. **Always prefer these over file-grepping or helper scripts.** Six are allowlisted
in `.claude/settings.json`, so **`delete_ticket` and `archive_ticket` both prompt** — do not assume a
tool runs unprompted because it reads as harmless. `create_ticket` is allowlisted but **blocked at
runtime by `guard-ticket`** (see **Ticket creation flow**). Servers load at session start and are
not hot-reloaded.

**This is the central board for every repo.** A global `track-steps` hook is the **only** pipeline
writer — a second one double-logs every milestone, so this repo wires no `PostToolUse` hook.
**`BOARD_DIR_OVERRIDE`** sets the board root (`?? CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR ?? cwd`, then `tickets/`,
`events/`); **`TICKETS_DIR_OVERRIDE`**/`EVENTS_DIR_OVERRIDE` override one directory and win over it.

**Read the envelope before trusting a count — its two extra fields mean different things, so never
merge them.** `list_tickets` caps at `limit` 100 and excludes `archived` unless asked.
**`unreadable`** names files whose frontmatter wouldn't parse: skipped *and* absent from `total`, so
a non-empty one means the board is bigger than every number shown. **`unassigned`** names open
tickets with no `project`: they **are** counted in `total` and returned on an unfiltered call, so
never add them to it — what they are missing from is every *project-filtered* view, which is what
makes them unselectable as work. That array caps at 20 with the true count in `note`, so
`unassigned.length` is a floor, not a count. Both are board-wide and never narrowed by your filters.

**MCP down → `npm run ticket`**, a fallback, not a second everyday path: `set <id> <field> <value>`
(`status | type | priority | project | assignee | dueDate | parent`), `append <id> <file>`, and
`npx ticket-workflow show <id>` to read a ticket back — which you need, because `update_ticket` can
error on response size *after* the write has already landed. It calls `appendBody` under an **in-process-only** lock, so a full-body `body`
write can still lose a concurrent edit — use `appendBody` regardless. The `tickets/.history/` snapshot
is an undo you may not have: best-effort, manual, and it does not survive `delete_ticket`.

## Ticket workflow

1. `list_tickets` to find the ticket.
2. `start_ticket` — sets `in-progress` and loads the body in one call. Then cut the branch.
3. **Feature and bug tickets: append a `## Done when` list first** — short, observable, checkable
   outcomes, fixing the exit condition while changing it is free. **Always `appendBody`, never a
   full-body `body` overwrite.**
4. **Test coverage** — evaluate what layers were touched, act on the **Testing** table. Never skipped
   silently.
5. **Quality gate** — `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`, all passing. (Docs-only tickets
   touching no code may skip it; say so.) **Then the mutation check.**
6. **Self-review** — read your own diff; `/verify` when runtime behaviour needs confirming. The
   `/code-review` is the *review gate* and belongs at the commit gate, not here. The ticket **stays
   `in-progress`** through self-review and commit; `qa` is set only at PR-open.
7. Append an `## Implementation summary`. Do **not** set `done` — that follows the merge.

**Definition of Done:** steps 4–7 complete, the gate green (or N/A for docs-only), a `## Done when`
list defined and holding for feature/bug tickets, the mutation check recorded, a `/code-review` run
before the commit with its findings addressed, and `status: done` set **after PR merge**.

### The mutation check (step 5) — nothing enforces this

For **feature/task** tickets adding or changing logic in a layer the Testing table covers, **plus the
`.claude` settings/hooks layer**. UI/CSS-only, docs and chores skip; bug tickets satisfy it via the
red repro, seam tickets via the round-trip test.

Name the diff's **authorizing line** — the guard or branch that *authorizes* the new behaviour, never
the happy-path line, and rarely the behaviour you were testing. Run the narrowest test selection that
should catch it and see it **green** (the positive control), flip the line, see **red**, revert,
confirm the tree is clean. A mutation the suite misses indicts the **mutation** first — verify it
applied — then the suite. If only e2e covers the line, record `mutation: none catchable — <reason>`
rather than bending an acceptance criterion to fit. The first `## Done when` item must be falsifiable
by *some* test; if none could be, fix the Done-when. **Never report this as enforced** — authoring
order is unobservable, exactly as for the red-first rule.

### The summary's two mandatory lines

- `Tests: N added — <what they cover>` · `Tests: none — <reason>`
- Bug tickets: `Tests: 1 added — <test name> (written first, observed red)`
- Feature/task tickets append: `; mutation: <file:line> flipped, observed red` — or
  `; mutation: none catchable — <reason>`
- `Risk: <what could break + how to roll back>` · `Risk: low — <why>`

**Both markers must sit on the same physical line as `Tests:`** — `adoption-markers.mjs` is
line-anchored, so a wrapped continuation silently doesn't count. In ticket bodies, quote either
template **only inside a code fence**; the probe strips fences so paperwork can never count as
adoption. They make adoption countable for the machine-wide promotions (`tkt-a98723f627df`,
`tkt-06b572e5f00e`), and `none catchable` counts as its own adopter category. The risk line rides into
the PR body, so blast radius and rollback are inline on every PR.

## Testing

Evaluate **each touched file independently**, never the ticket as a whole.

| Layer touched | Test file |
|---|---|
| `server/tickets.ts`, `server/events.ts`, `server/validation.ts`, `mcp/handlers.ts` (re-export shims) | **none** — covered upstream in `ticket-workflow` |
| `server/index.ts` (API routes) | `server/index.test.ts` |
| `src/lib/` (shared utilities) | `src/lib/*.test.ts` next to the file |
| React components / CSS only | skip |

**Do not re-create local suites for the shims** — upstream's gate runs against its own HEAD, not the
tag pinned here, so `server/packageContract.test.ts` asserts the **pinned build** through the shim.
**Add to that file when a dependency bump could
regress behaviour kanban relies on**; it is deliberately narrow, covering only what no other kanban
test asserts.
Redirect I/O with `TICKETS_DIR_OVERRIDE`, never touching the real `tickets/`, and seed fixtures with
the `makeRaw`/`writeRaw` helpers rather than round-tripping `createTicket`. **Cover the happy path,
edge cases (empty input, boundary values) and rejection cases (invalid input, missing resources)** —
not the happy path alone. **Skip tests only for pure UI**; everything else owes at least a
happy-path test, with the skip reason in the summary.

### Integration seams — MANDATORY for cross-module data flows

The general rule is `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` → *Cross-module changes need one round-trip test*; here it
is **MANDATORY**. **This repo's seam** is `model proposal → proposalToPrefill → form →
changedFormFields → createTicket/updateTicket → provenance`. Drive the *real* chain with this repo's
stubs — a fake chat client plus `TICKETS_DIR_OVERRIDE`/`RUNS_DIR_OVERRIDE` — and write the round-trip
test **first**, TDD-ing against it. For integration-heavy PRs add a **flow-scoped** review angle:
"trace this value from source to sink; list every transformation or drop."

### Bug tickets: failing repro first — MANDATORY

**Write the failing reproduction first, watch it go red, then write the fix.**

**A repro that PASSES before the fix is the finding** — the test misses the defect; it does not mean
the bug is absent. Before fixing anything, grep the tests and read the test *name*: a green test may
be pinning the very defect you were asked to fix.

**Scope:** bug tickets touching a layer the Testing table covers. UI/CSS-only is already skipped
there, and for a seam bug the round-trip test *is* the repro. Record it on the existing `Tests:` line.
**Nothing enforces this** — authoring order is unobservable and `tickets/` is gitignored, so CI can
never read that line. Do not report it as enforced.

### Ticket creation flow (authored by the local LLM)

Every **new** ticket is authored by the local intake agent, **not Claude**, so its wording and
classification happen inside a **metered** run. `create_ticket` is blocked by the `guard-ticket`
PreToolUse hook — enforced. It guards the *tool*, not the data, and its user-scope half is
machine-local, so the policy below is the default wherever the hook can't reach.

1. **Confirm the report once**, restating the *substance* in one line. Don't pre-negotiate
   type/priority/status/project — the agent classifies them.
2. **Delegate** — `npm run agent -- --yes --create-only "<the report, in the user's words>"`. `--yes`
   puts the write **inside** the metered run; `--create-only` drops `update_ticket`, so a mis-matched
   retrieval can only create a **new** ticket, never clobber a body.

   **ONE ISSUE PER RUN — the rule, not a preference.** A report covering several things gets
   **sprayed** into several thin tickets, and that includes *enumeration inside prose*: "three rules
   have no test: X, Y and Z" is a list as far as the model is concerned. Describe **one symptom** and
   add sub-parts yourself with `update_ticket`; for several findings, make several runs. The runtime
   biases toward one ticket and caps a run at 3 creates, but **neither replaces this rule** — a prompt
   is a bias on a local model, and the cap prevents a runaway, not a 2–3-way split. When it fires the
   CLI prints `! N further create_ticket call(s) were blocked`: the report was too broad, so re-file
   the remainder as separate single-issue runs rather than raising the cap.
3. **Report what landed** — id plus classified fields. **Always `get_ticket` the result**: check for a
   mis-matched related-id and a body that drifted off the report, then fix via `update_ticket`.
4. **Local model down → block, don't fall back.** Say so and **stop**; never hand-author the ticket.

**Claude's directly:** structured-field updates via `update_ticket`; body edits and the
`## Implementation summary` via `appendBody`; `delete_ticket` (still prompts).

## Concurrent sessions: one worktree each

Two sessions sharing one working tree is not safe — whichever stages a shared file first absorbs the
other's in-flight edits. Use `EnterWorktree`/`ExitWorktree`, not a hand-rolled convention.

- **Rename the branch before the first commit** — `EnterWorktree` prefixes `worktree-` and rewrites
  `/` as `+`, failing the required `branch-name` check. `git branch -m <prefix>/<id>-<slug>`.
- **`node_modules` needs no handling** — **except** a ticket bumping a dependency, which must
  `npm install` *in* the worktree or the suite proves nothing.
- **Two dev servers: set `KANBAN_PORT_OFFSET`** — it shifts the API and Vite ports **together**.
- **`gh pr merge --delete-branch` errors from a worktree and the merge still landed. Do not retry.**
  Confirm `gh pr view <n> --json state` is `MERGED`, then `git push origin --delete <branch>` and
  `git pull --ff-only` in the *primary* checkout. The local branch survives; no agent can remove it.
- **The embedded terminal is not isolated by this** — its container mounts the *host* checkout.

## Branch, commit & PR workflow

Every ticket lands on its own branch and merges to `main` via a **squash-merged PR** — never a direct
push. **Four** human-approval gates, in order: **commit** (*"Ready to commit?"*), **review** (the
`/code-review`, raised at the commit gate and resolved *before* the commit), **PR open** (*"Ready to
open PR?"*), **merge** (*"Ready to merge?"*). Each needs explicit confirmation; the review gate needs
a review to have **run**, not merely been offered.

**Never cross a gate without explicit confirmation.** The review gate is the one easy to lose, because
it is the only one whose absence looks like nothing having happened — so it is a **precondition on the
PR**, not a question that may be answered "no": **do not open a PR, and never merge, until a
`/code-review` has run for this ticket.** Jake decides *when to spend the tokens*, not whether the
review happens. **Ask the gates with `AskUserQuestion`**; it renders 2–4 options, so a gate must offer
a genuine alternative (*Hold — I want to look first*), never a lone OK button. It changes how a gate
is **asked**, never whether approval is required — a typed reply is still a valid answer to any
gate, which is what keeps them crossable where `AskUserQuestion` is unavailable.

> **The review gate's ordering is deliberate — the review resolves BEFORE the commit, and do not
> "fix" that back.** Findings get addressed before they are baked into a commit. **Do not restore the
> argument this replaces** — "pre-commit, a misdirected review meets a clean tree and says nothing"
> is false, and `SKILL.md` §10 refutes it: the harness falls back to a branch-vs-`main` range, so a
> review pointed at the wrong repo returns a full, confident, plausible report about a branch that
> merged weeks ago. What actually catches that is §10's scope check — compare the files the review
> says it read against your own diff. Zero findings proves nothing in either direction.
>
> **Who runs it is mode-dependent** — by default Jake; `/kanban-workflow`'s auto levels pre-authorize
> the skill to. **The merge gate stays human in every mode.** **Do not report the review gate as
> enforced, or as unenforceable**: `record_review`'s milestone is written automatically by a passing
> commit too, so gating on it today would be a rubber stamp (`tkt-55080f378279`).

**Enforced locally:** `.claude/hooks/guard-bash.mjs` blocks the dangerous *shapes* — `git add -A`/`.`,
`commit -a`, commits and pushes to `main`, force-push, `branch -D`, `reset --hard`, `clean -f`,
`checkout -f` — and **fails closed** on `commit`/`push` when it cannot resolve the branch. **Fix the
environment if you hit that; never route around the guard.** `.claude/settings.audit.test.mjs` is the
executable record of the permission model — read it rather than a summary.

**What guards `gh` is not nothing, and is not everything — do not round it to either.** The pinned
package's own guard never inspects `gh`, but the wired launcher sequences
`.claude/hooks/guard-unattended-merge.mjs`, which blocks `gh pr merge` **and** the
`/repos/.../pulls/.../merge` REST shape with exit 2 while a night-run sentinel is active; and
`guard-subagent-gates` blocks a *subagent* merge. So an exit-2 block on a merge is the guard doing
its job — read the message, do not route around it. What remains unguarded is the ordinary case:
**on the main thread with no night run active, nothing enforces the merge gate**, so treat "Ready to
merge?" as the actual control it is. `settings.local.json` is gitignored, so its broader rules can
only be checked locally, and `guard-subagent-gates` lives only in `~/.claude/settings.json`.

### 1. Branch (at `start_ticket`)

```bash
git switch main && git pull
git switch -c <prefix>/<id>-<slug>
```

`<prefix>` maps the ticket `type` (`bug→fix`, `feature→feat`, `task→task`, `chore→chore`); `<id>` is
the full ticket id; `<slug>` is the title kebab-cased to ~4–5 words.

### 2. Commit

Ask **"Ready to commit?"**. **This is where the review gate is raised:** offer the `/code-review`,
wait for it to run, address its findings *before* committing. "Not now" defers the commit; it does not
skip the review. **Always name the target repo in the args** — a bare call reviews the session's cwd
and has silently reviewed the wrong branch. Then `git add` only this ticket's files (never `-A`):

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<Imperative summary under 72 chars>

<1–3 sentences on why, not what. Omit if the summary is self-contained.>

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

Commit as often as the work needs — the squash-merge collapses the branch to one commit on `main`.
Never put two tickets on one branch.

### 3. PR

**Confirm the review gate was crossed before asking** — if no `/code-review` has run, go back to it;
nothing downstream will catch this. Then ask **"Ready to open PR?"**:

```bash
git push -u origin <prefix>/<id>-<slug>
gh pr create --base main --title "<ticket title>" --body "<why + ticket id + the ## Implementation summary>"
```

At PR-open, `update_ticket` to `status: "qa"` — **the single point a ticket enters `qa`**.

**Which checks run and block is mutable external state — probe it, don't recall it.**
`gh workflow list --all` says which workflows are enabled; a *disabled* one contributes no check at
all, so `gh pr checks` exiting 0 does **not** mean everything ran. `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets`
says which are required and who can bypass. As of 2026-08-17 `code-review` is `disabled_manually` and
the `review` ruleset is parked pending `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (`tkt-16b6e37a1cbb`, `tkt-f9782ff3fdf5`) —
**so the review gate at the commit gate is the only automated-tooling review this repo gets.**

### 4. Merge

Read any review comment (`gh pr view <number> --comments`). On significant findings ask: **"Fix these
in the current PR, or create follow-up tickets?"** — follow-ups go through the local agent, one issue
per run. Then ask **"Ready to merge?"**; never merge without explicit approval, in any mode.

```bash
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch
git switch main && git pull
```

No `--admin`: the active ruleset requires checks but **0 approvals**. Then, in order:
**`ExitWorktree`** if the ticket ran in one — an abandoned worktree leaves a stale copy of *this file*
on disk, and stale prose **instructs** — then **`update_ticket` to `status: "done"`**.

**From the embedded terminal the session has push + open-PR authority only.** Do not attempt
`gh pr merge` there: print the URL and say merging is the human's decision.

## Conventions, structure and probes

Backed by a mechanism or by the repo itself, so this file carries the rule and `docs/claude-md/`
carries the detail.

**Temporary scripts:** never write one to mutate ticket state — `update_ticket` does that. For a
genuine one-off needing the service layer, write it to the **project root**, run
`node_modules/.bin/tsx <script>.ts`, delete it. Not `/tmp`, not the scratchpad.

**TypeScript is lint-enforced** (`eslint.config.js`): no type casting (`as Foo`/`as any`), no non-null
assertions (`foo!`), no `any`/`unknown` in your own types. `as const` stays allowed.

**Comments are sparse** — only a non-obvious *why* (invariants, security/concurrency/atomicity
decisions, gotchas, ticket refs), as terse one-liners, never per-function prose headers. Delete
anything restating what the code says. Exempt: compiler/coverage directives and the "commented
exclusion" pattern documenting a deliberate cross-layer field omission. This **supersedes** any
instinct to match the codebase's former density.

**The agent is local-first by default and local-only in practice** — an OpenAI-compatible `/v1`
endpoint, no cloud key, runs air-gapped. Target the `LLM_BASE_URL`/`LLM_MODEL` seam; do **not** reach
for the Anthropic SDK, push a cloud deployment, or invoke the `claude-api` skill unless asked. Cost is
**measured, not estimated** — energy ($ from kWh × regional rate).

**Structure** is discoverable from the tree; two entries carry a constraint that is not.
`shared/ports.ts` derives the dev API and Vite ports from one `KANBAN_PORT_OFFSET` knob, imported by
both `vite.config.ts` and `server/index.ts` so they can never disagree. `shared/terminalSeed.mjs`
stays `.mjs` with a hand-written `.d.mts` **because the setup scripts run under bare `node` and cannot
import TypeScript** — do not "fix" it into a `.ts`.

**`.claude/skills/kanban-workflow/` is project-scoped and tracked, and the tracked copy is the one
that loads** (measured 2026-08-18, `tkt-9fbe6c952590`; the former user-scope duplicate, which used to
win, is deleted). `SKILL.md` must stay free of absolute paths; the project→repo map is **gitignored**
`repos.local.json`. `repoHygiene.test.mjs` fails the suite on a home path naming a real account, or an
unexpected tracked file there, reaching the **index**; `skillContract.test.mjs` binds `SKILL.md` to
this file — **read the live set off the `it` cases in that file**, never a summary.

**Probes:** a recurring, code-shaped question gets a tested probe under `scripts/probe/` with a
built-in control that fails loud — never an ad-hoc grep. Each throws rather than return a false zero,
and exits non-zero rather than call an unscannable target clean; read the header of the one you need.
**Promotion decisions read `adoption-markers.mjs`, never an ad-hoc grep**, and `repo-stats.mjs` is
the source for the published repo stats — never hand-transcribe those.
Three rules ride with them, none enforced: **never change a ticket's status off `stale-in-progress`
output** (its phrase list is incomplete by construction, so a human reading the actual words is the
check on the instrument); **do not delete an instruction on the strength of one A/B** until
`clean-room.mjs` reports `CLEAN`; and **do not build an assertion-word probe over prose** — measured
at ~2% precision, because the claims that rot are unremarkable declaratives, not the hedged sentences
those words select for.
